## About

It is based on the Jekyll theme `just-the-docs`

## Setup

1. Install a working version of ruby 3
2. Install bundler by running `gem install bundler`
3. `bundle install`
3. Copy the `./docs` folder from `package_parser` in to the `./docs` folder within this repository
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll build` 
5. Move the `_site` folder to your desired location to view the static site
